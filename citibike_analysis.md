## Proposal for Sharing-Bike program in Des Moines
According to the U.S. Census, the estimated population of Des Moines in 2010 is 203,433. The population per square mile is 2429/46. Comparing to New York City, the city of Des Moines is not a densely populated city. However, Des Moines is a great place for a visit. The city of Des Moines is a cultural center for Iowa, and there are people visiting for festival and some special events throughout the year. 
In addition, people are most likely using bike-sharing program when the city is densely packed with both tourist and local resident. In metropolitan area of a city, public transportation is the top choice for commute due to the convenience. However, during the peak tourist season or daily rush hours, public transportation will be fully occupied most of the time. At those moment, biking inside the city is more convenience and time saving method. No matter if one is a tourist or a local resident, riding a bike gives one more freedom to travel between two places. In addition, one doesn’t need to worry if there’s a parking space or not. The bike-sharing program will provide designated parking space for the bikes.
